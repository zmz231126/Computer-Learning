# the Map Method
- The truth table represention of function is unique, expressed algebraically, if can appera in
many different forms.
- Boolean functions can be simplified by algebraic means. However the prodecure of minimization
  is awkward because it lacks specific rules to predict each succeeding step in the manipulative
  process
- The map method provides a simple straightforward procedure fo minimizing Boolean functions.
  This method may be regarded either as a pictorial form of a truth table or as an extension
  of Venn diagram.

The map represents a visual diagram of all possible ways a function may be expressed in a standard form.
By recognizing various patterns, the user can derive alternative algebraic expressions for the 
same function, from which he can select the simplest one.
